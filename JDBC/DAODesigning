Rules for DAO Desgining:
[It is a general desgin pattern,we can use it anywhere]
Should have one interface with common abstact method then give the implementation in a class which does the operation .
Create a factory method in factory class and call that factory method to get the object of type that DAO inteface.
In DAO we should not write any other code apart from that jdbc code.
